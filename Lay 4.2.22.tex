\section*{Problem 4.2.22}
With A as in Exercise 3, find the nonzero vector in Nul A and a nonzero Vector in Col A.\\
\\
Finding Nul A, we began with the equation $ A\vec{x}=0$ in matrix form.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 &5 & 0& 0 \\
0 &1 &4 &-2 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\sim
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 &-7 &6 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 4 &-2 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
Now we have the equations 
\begin{align*}
 x_1 &= 7x_3 -6x_4\\
 x_2 &=-4x_3+2x_4 
\end{align*}
since $ x_3$ and $x_4$ are free we can assign a value of one to each and solve for $x_1$ and $ x_2$, which creates a vector in Nul A.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
-2\\
1\\
1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\]
 To find Col A  you can pick any vector in your original A matrix and you'd have a correct answer.
